## The Switch
Given the HTML and CSS as provided, use JavaScript to hear the click of the switch and meet the following criteria:

- When someone hits the button in the switch, remove the current state class (on/off), and apply the opposite class (on/off)
- Swap the colours of the body's background and text by adding or removing the dark/light class
- Lastly, change the text in box to say "It's so bright in here!" when it's on, and "Hey, who turned off the lights?" when it's off

## Hints
Start with small steps:

1. Change the status text when the document is ready
2. Add a click listener to the switch and incorporate the changes listed above in 'Your Assignment'
3. Confirm the switch works
4. How do we switch the classes back now?
  - use an `if` statement to change the text
  - you should be able to click the switch many times and it should switch back and forth between light and dark modes
